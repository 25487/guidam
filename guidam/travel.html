  <p>There are different ways to travel within the city!</p>


  <h3>Public Transport</h3>
  <p>
    Amsterdam has an efficient public transport system with various bus and tram routes, metro lines and ferry links.
    The authority that operates them is called GVB which stands for Gemeentevervoerbedrijf (Municipal Transport
    Authority). The best way to find your way around is by using the public transport enquiries app called 9292. Their
    website <a href="https://9292.nl/">9292ov.nl</a>, which is also available in English and German, offers
    information about rates, routes, lines
    and timetables. <a href="https://www.google.nl/maps">Google Maps</a> also offers information on public transport.

    <h4 id="tram">Tram</h4>
    <p>Trams are a great way to get around the city of Amsterdam, as they connect major squares (or plein in Dutch),
      train stations and most of the outskirts of the city. The most significant stops include Amsterdam Centraal,
      Amstel, De Dam, Leidseplein, and Rembrandtplein. Most of the tramlines interconnect with other trams, metro, or
      buses at one of these places. </p>

    <h4 id="bus">Bus</h4>
    <p>Amsterdam has various bus lines and a regional network connecting the capital to surrounding suburbs and towns.
      Remember when travelling by bus to raise your hand when you want to get on, to ensure that the driver has seen
      you, and to enter at the front. </p>

    <h4 id="metro">Metro</h4>
    <p>Amsterdam has five metro lines: 50, 51, 52, 53 and 54. Lines 53 and 54 run from Central Station to Amsterdam
      Zuidoost. The new metro line 52 takes you from north to south Amsterdam in 15 minutes. Line 51 runs from Central
      Station to Isolatorweg and line 50 runs from Gein in the southeast to Isolatorweg (near Amsterdam Sloterdijk
      Station) in the northwest.</p>

    <h4 id="ferries">Ferries</h4>
    <p>GVB operates nine ferry connections across the IJ and North Sea Channel. Ferries are free for cyclists and
      pe-destrians. The ferries from Central Station to Amsterdam Noord behind Central Station run all day and all
      night.</p>

    <h4 id="train">Train</h4>
    <p>Amsterdam has 15 train stations, and the railway network is operated by the Dutch national railway company,
      Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS). For information on trains and departure times you can download the NS
      Reisplanner-app in your app/play store. You can take your bicycle on the train, but only if you buy a separate
      day ticket for it, at a cost of € 6.90. You can’t bring your bicycle in peak hours.</p>
